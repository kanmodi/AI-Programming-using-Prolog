# AI-Programming-using-Prolog

Run these programs in SWI-Prolog for Windows.
The SWI-Prolog executable swipl-win.exe can be started from the StartMenu or by opening a .pl file holding Prolog program text from the Windows explorer.
Be sure to get the quotes right and terminate the command with a full-stop (.).
If Prolog is started from the start menu it is passed the option --win_app, which causes it to start in the local equivalent of MyDocuments\Prolog. This folder is created if it does not exist.
After loading a program, one can ask Prolog queries about the program.
